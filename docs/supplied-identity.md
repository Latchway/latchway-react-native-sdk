# Shared accounts with developer-supplied identity

This guide describes React Native 2.0.1's fresh supplied-identity account model,
with iOS 2.0.1 and Android 1.2.2. The gateway requirement is server
1.1.1 or later, contract 1.1.0 / wire 3 with `supplied_identity_v1`.

The same integration works in a standalone RN app or an RN screen embedded in
a native app. Either side can configure first. Matching public configuration
reuses one native app, installation, account session and refresh coordinator.
There is no Firebase dependency, native Latchway bootstrap, authority registration
or embedded-mode switch in this integration.

## Configure

Install `@latchway/react-native@2.0.1`, update Pods and rebuild both native apps.
JavaScript and native bridge ABI 3 must be upgraded together; no JS-only update.
Keep one native SDK copy if the host already uses Latchway directly.

```ts
import {Latchway, firebaseProject} from '@latchway/react-native';

export const app = await Latchway.configure({
  baseURL: 'https://your-gateway.example',
  applicationID: 'app_01J00000000000000000000000',
  environment: 'production',
  identity: firebaseProject({projectID: 'your-project-id'}),
  apple: {rootKeychainAccessGroup: 'YOURTEAM.com.example.app'},
  android: {playIntegrityCloudProjectNumber: '123456789012'},
});
```

Use the actual signed root Keychain access group; do not guess it from the team
and bundle alone. Keep App Attest and Play Integrity configured for the signed
application. Supplying these public identifiers cannot grant trust by itself.
`applicationID` is a Latchway resource ID, not a Firebase app ID or bundle ID.

`firebaseProject` formats issuer/audience metadata only. It imports no Firebase
module, fetches no token and installs no listener. A generic issuer uses
`identity: {providerID, issuer, audience, tenantID?}`. The provider must already
be configured in the selected gateway environment.

`configure` does not sign in or reactivate a logged-out account. Omitted optional
values inherit an existing registration; conflicting explicit values throw
`configuration_conflict`. Named apps must agree between native and RN callers.

## Supply identity and use the client

After an accepted login in your application's existing authentication flow:

```ts
const account = await app.signIn({
  getIdToken: () => yourAuth.getIdToken(),
});
const client = await account.makeClient();
```

`yourAuth` belongs to your application. The callback is invoked once after the
native SDK captures a lifecycle ticket; it is not kept as a permanent JS owner.
Use `{idToken: token}` if you already have a current token. Do not put tokens in
static configuration, source files, logs or crash-report metadata.

An already-configured native/RN caller can attach without another login:

```ts
const client = await app.makeClient();
// Or capture the shared account for later token updates:
const account = await app.currentAccount();
```

For initial application-auth restoration use `app.restore({getIdToken})`, not an
unconditional `signIn` on every screen mount. Restore cannot reverse a recorded
Latchway logout; an accepted new login or explicit user resume action can sign in.

## Refresh, logout and cancellation

```ts
// Same account only. The gateway verifies the replacement before accepting it.
await account.updateIdToken({getIdToken: () => yourAuth.getIdToken()});

// In the serialized application auth flow, stop UI/tool work first.
await app.signOut();
await yourAuth.signOut(); // Your provider is not signed out by Latchway.

// Screen teardown only:
abortController.abort();
await client.dispose();
```

`app.signOut(): Promise<void>` is the recommended application sign-out API.
It delegates to the shared native app and works without a current account or
generation ID: before sign-in returns, after process restart with persisted
state, or while an earlier cleanup is unfinished. Configure the app after
process startup first; `getApp()` retrieves only an already-configured app.
It fences pending identity
acquisition/refresh and retires the selected app's account across native and RN
callers. Repeating it after successful cleanup is safe; repeating it after a
cleanup failure retries that cleanup. A physical Keychain/Keystore or storage
failure still rejects. Keep protected UI disabled, make storage accessible and
retry `app.signOut()` before accepting another login. Do not swallow that error
or fall back to a different account/legacy client.

Sign-out is scoped to this named app on this installation, not every configured
app or every device. It does not need an identity-token callback or an online
provider logout. It does not reset quotas or undo already dispatched requests;
those requests may still be billed. `account.logout()`, generation-targeted
`app.logout(generationID)` and `client.logout()` remain available for operations
that deliberately target a captured account generation.

### Native-owned authentication

If the native host owns authentication, its auth controller must notify Latchway
on every sign-out/account replacement—even if no AI feature has been opened or
React Native has never mounted. Use the same named app configured by either
side, serialize the auth transition, and await its native sign-out:

```swift
// Swift: the shared LatchwayApp, not a newly constructed legacy client.
try await app.signOut()
// Then perform the application's external provider sign-out.
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin: call the shared LatchwayApp's suspend function from the auth coroutine.
app.signOut()
// Then perform the application's external provider sign-out.
```

Do not depend on a React Native auth listener being alive to perform native
sign-out. A provider's own sign-out never notifies Latchway automatically. For
an app with several independent named Latchway apps, its auth owner must sign out
each app affected by the external account change. See
[shared native apps](shared-native-apps.md) for attachment and ownership details.

### Cancellation and token freshness

All acquisition operations accept `signal`. Aborting also fences the native
ticket, including when first sign-in has not returned an account. The native
backend rejects stale completions and account A's late refresh/logout cannot
change account B. Keep external provider login/logout mutations serialized in
your application; Latchway cannot order provider calls that bypass it.

ID tokens live in native process memory and are erased on logout/replacement.
Native requests can continue after JS stops while the supplied identity remains
fresh and has not been reported changed. At expiry, `identity_refresh_required`
blocks protected work until the application supplies a valid fresh token.
Expiry suspends rather than logs out; refresh cannot reactivate a retired account.

The library cannot detect an unreported Firebase/Auth0/etc. logout or refresh
tokens from a project ID. Every application auth-changing surface must notify
Latchway. Process restart requires a token supplied by application auth again.

## Optional provider-neutral binding

Applications with centralized auth events can use one injected subscription:

```ts
import {bindLatchwayAuth} from '@latchway/react-native';

const binding = await bindLatchwayAuth(app, {
  subscribe: listener => yourAuth.subscribeLatchwayEvents(listener),
  onError: error => showConnectionError(error),
});
```

Your event adapter emits `{type: 'restore' | 'signIn' | 'tokenChanged', getIdToken}`
or `{type: 'signOut'}`. Events express application intent; the helper never
infers a fresh login from a changed Firebase User object. A native binding lease
rejects a competing subscription, including through another RN wrapper/runtime.
Dispose the binding when its auth owner ends, not on every screen unmount.
`await binding.dispose()` cancels pending work and releases the subscription;
it does not log out the shared account. Other teams need only attach to the app.
The `signOut` event uses app-level sign-out, including when no account handle
was returned. `onError` must surface cleanup failures; an event listener does
not replace awaiting sign-out in the auth owner's serialized transition.

## LangChain

Keep LangChain and any runtime polyfills in the consuming app. Pass the client
to the existing feature-bound adapter; the server selects the upstream/model.
See [the LangChain guide](https://docs.latchway.dev/clients/react-native/framework-integrations). Account changes should abort streams,
tool execution and UI updates and clear in-memory chat history. The SDK handles
native account isolation; it does not own your screen's state.

## Fresh storage and limits

- Shared mode requires an explicit `sharedNativeCallers` policy with the same
  required host attestation. Upgrading the server does not widen app policies.
- The current public entry point is `Latchway.configure`, followed by
  `signIn`/`restore` and opaque account handles. There is no direct root-client
  constructor, identity-owner transfer or old-session adoption path.
- Storage is account-scoped from first use. No old-store inventory or cleanup
  callback is required. Current component allowlists, root-private Keychain
  isolation, persistent logout and cleanup-retry journals remain enforced.
- Logout never resets server-side per-user quotas or logs out other devices.
- Android libraries compile against API 34; the host's target SDK and other
  dependencies can require a newer compile SDK. React Native 0.74+/React 18.2+
  still require the compatible host toolchain and New Architecture.
