# Development attestation

These instructions require gateway 1.1.3 or later, supporting
`appAttest.environment: any` and the Development-only Play
testing exception. Deploy it before enabling these policies; environments are not changed
automatically by installing this SDK.
Keep ordinary `Latchway.configure`, application-supplied identity and shared
native accounts. No new Firebase dependency, native bootstrap or JS attestation
flag is required. Never send raw Apple evidence or Google tokens from JavaScript.

## Local iOS builds and TestFlight

The gateway's `appAttest.environment` accepts `development`, `production`, or
`any`. These describe accepted Apple evidence, not the Latchway environment
name. Typically use `any` for Latchway Development and `production` for
Production, with the intended distribution categories and bundle versions
separately allowed for native iOS and RN iOS.

Distribution and build checks use Apple's signed metadata when present. Older
proofs can omit it and do not establish cryptographic proof of distribution or
build. Accepting `any` changes only Apple-environment acceptance.

Apple's signed entitlement only accepts `development` or `production`, never
`any`. Local development normally uses the sandbox; TestFlight uses production
regardless of the entitlement. Keep `apple.rootKeychainAccessGroup` and normal
signing configured. Do not infer Apple evidence from `__DEV__` or disable App
Attest. See [Apple's entitlement reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.devicecheck.appattest-environment).

The native SDK owns persisted App Attest state. If Apple reports `invalidKey`
after replacing a build with a different App Attest environment, it attempts
one replacement key and fresh attestation. A server policy rejection does not
itself rotate an accepted key. Fix policy/signing rather than clearing Keychain
or adding JS retries. Sandbox and production keys are not interchangeable.

## Google Play testing

Configure the public decimal project number for the selected Latchway
environment in `android.playIntegrityCloudProjectNumber`. Use explicit app
environment configuration rather than assuming `__DEV__` selects the right
backend: a release build may intentionally use Development. Embedded native and
RN callers must agree, and changes require a full native process restart.

In Play Console, configure dedicated developer Google accounts under **Protected
with Play → Play Integrity API → Manage → Testing**, with access to the app's
testing release and suitable recognized/licensed/device verdicts. These are
device Google Play accounts, not the Firebase users supplied to Latchway.
Google marks the token as a testing response; only the server reads that flag.
[Google's testing instructions](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/additional-tools)

The development gateway must explicitly enable the Play Integrity policy's
`allowTestingResponses`. Keep the normal `device_verified` or
`strong_device_verified` minimum: the server permits a provider-scoped exception
only in the opted-in Development environment and retains actual `debug` trust.
Real device responses still work there. Custom feature/CEL rules explicitly
requiring `installation.trust_level == 'device_verified'` still reject `debug`;
review them deliberately rather than lowering global trust requirements.
Production keeps rejecting testing responses. Actual package, certificate and
request bindings, authentication and quota remain enforced. A debug certificate may need
explicit development allowlisting; a locally installed APK is not guaranteed
to pass. Test accounts/overrides are not isolated merely by selecting a separate
Cloud project. Firebase App Check debug tokens are not a substitute.

Activating a configuration revision requires fresh mobile attestation evidence
before an existing session can refresh. Expect a brief re-attestation through
the native SDK; an older accepted proof does not preserve access under a newly
changed policy.

## What to verify

- On a physical Apple device, exercise both a local build and TestFlight against
  Development, including subsequent assertions and a build-channel transition.
- On Android, obtain a real Google-issued testing token through the native SDK
  and confirm the server reports `debug`; also exercise a rejected verdict.
- Check production-only policies reject development Apple proofs and Google
  testing responses, including refresh of previously accepted evidence.
- Repeat with native-first and RN-first configure using the same app/account.

Development Apple attestation is genuine Apple evidence. Google testing
responses simulate verdicts and are never upgraded to genuine device trust.
Neither fixture tests nor this workflow substitutes for the separately scoped
[production physical-device evidence](physical-device-evidence.md).
